 Dreams are what a person sees and hears in their mind when they are sleeping They are often similar to real life in some ways but can also be very strange Dreams can seem so real while they happen that the person might think that they are awake when actually they are asleep Sometimes a person realizes during a dream that they are dreaming but keeps having the dream This is called a lucid dream This happens very little for most people but for some people it happens often During lucid dreaming the person will feel like they are controlling the dream and will usually dream that they are doing fun things that they can t do in the real world Most people remember their dreams in some way or another even if it s only a small part but children are very likely to remember most of their dream clearly It s often easier for people to remember dreams if they write down what happened in the dream just after they wake up Because of this many people have dream diaries where they describe each dream they have Nightmare s are dreams which scare or shock people Nightmares are usually based around that person s everyday fears like spiders or dark places but even a dream that s not about those things can feel unpleasant Nightmares are caused by many different things being uncomfortable or in pain while sleeping sickness Stress stress or even eating right before sleeping There are many different Theory theories about why people dream and what their dreams mean Every person has different dreams Some psychologist s believe that dreams reflect what is happening in the unconscious mind Others think that people places and objects in dreams are symbols for other things in the dreamer s real life Throughout history people have tried to make sense of dreams to learn things from them and have often used them for divination or fortune telling Today there are still many books and websites devoted to making sense of dreams
