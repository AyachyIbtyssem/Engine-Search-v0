A zygote is the fertilization fertilized cell that will grow into a new animal or plant When a female s ovum and a male s sperm cell fertilization join the cell that results is called the zygote The zygote then multiplies and grows into an embryo So a zygote is formed from the union of two gametes and is the first stage in a organism s development Zygotes are produced by fertilization between two haploid cells the ovum and the sperm cells which make a diploid cell Diploid cells have copies of both parents chromosomes and DNA Some animals keep the zygote in their bodies until it is a full grown baby The time between the forming of the zygote and the baby s birth is called pregnancy Other animals do not keep the zygote in their bodies but lay an egg egg The zygote grows inside the egg until it is ready and a larva or baby animal hatches
