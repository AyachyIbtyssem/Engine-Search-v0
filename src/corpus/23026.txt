 Over the counter drugs are drugs that do not need a prescription to be bought When they are properly used these drugs do not put the health of the patient in danger Many OTC drug ingredients which were prescription drugs are now considered safe enough for use without a prescription In many countries there are special government agencies that regulate OTC drugs such as the Food and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement Administration in the United States Certain drugs are classified as over the counter drugs but may only be given by a pharmacist This is often the case with emergency contraception medicine It may also be the case that a small packet of a certain drug is available over the counter but that larger packets require a prescription
